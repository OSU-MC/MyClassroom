## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please create a GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/OSU-MC/MyClassroom/issues) if you encounter any vulnerabilities (outside of dependancy updates). These are regularly checked and updated with statuses. If a stable release version has been tagged and a vulnerability issue goes unread, please reach out to the project maintainers.
